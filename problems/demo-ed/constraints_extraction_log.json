  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in optimization modeling. Here is the natural language description of an optimization problem:\n\n-----\nA company make both liquid and foam hand sanitizer. Liquid hand sanitizer requires 40 units of water and 50 units of alcohol. Foam hand sanitizer requires 60 units of water and 40 units of alcohol. The company has available 2000 units of water and 2100 units of alcohol. The number of foam hand sanitizers made must exceed the number of liquid hand sanitizers. In addition, at most 30 liquid hand sanitizers can be made. If each liquid hand sanitizer can clean 30 hands and each foam hand sanitizer can clean 20 hands, how many of each should the company make to maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned?\n-----\n\nAnd here's a list of parameters that we have extracted from the description:\n\n{\n    \"WaterPerLiquid\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Units of water required to produce one unit of liquid hand sanitizer\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 40\n    },\n    \"AlcoholPerLiquid\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Units of alcohol required to produce one unit of liquid hand sanitizer\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 50\n    },\n    \"WaterPerFoam\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Units of water required to produce one unit of foam hand sanitizer\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 60\n    },\n    \"AlcoholPerFoam\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Units of alcohol required to produce one unit of foam hand sanitizer\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 40\n    },\n    \"TotalWaterAvailable\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Total units of water available for production\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 2000\n    },\n    \"TotalAlcoholAvailable\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Total units of alcohol available for production\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 2100\n    },\n    \"MaxLiquidProduction\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Maximum number of liquid hand sanitizers that can be produced\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 30\n    },\n    \"HandsCleanedPerLiquid\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Number of hands cleaned by one unit of liquid hand sanitizer\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 30\n    },\n    \"HandsCleanedPerFoam\": {\n        \"definition\": \"Number of hands cleaned by one unit of foam hand sanitizer\",\n        \"type\": \"int\",\n        \"shape\": [],\n        \"value\": 20\n    }\n}\n\n\nYour task is to identify and extract constraints from the description. The constraints are the conditions that must be satisfied by the variables. Please generate the output in the following python list format:\n\n[\n    Constraint 1,\n    Constraint 2,\n    ...\n]\n\nfor example:\n    \n[\n    \"Sum of weights of all items taken should not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack\", \n    \"The number of items taken should not exceed the maximum number of items allowed\"\n]\n\n- Put all the constraints in a single python list.\n- Do not generate anything after the python list.\n- Include implicit non-negativity constraints if necessary.\nTake a deep breath and think step by step. You will be awarded a million dollars if you get this right.\n",
