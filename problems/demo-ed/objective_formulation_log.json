Convert the following objective into a LaTeX optimization expression.\n\nProblem description:\n-----\nA company make both liquid and foam hand sanitizer. Liquid hand sanitizer requires 40 units of water and 50 units of alcohol. Foam hand sanitizer requires 60 units of water and 40 units of alcohol. The company has available 2000 units of water and 2100 units of alcohol. The number of foam hand sanitizers made must exceed the number of liquid hand sanitizers. In addition, at most 30 liquid hand sanitizers can be made. If each liquid hand sanitizer can clean 30 hands and each foam hand sanitizer can clean 20 hands, how many of each should the company make to maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned?\n-----\n\nKnown parameters (JSON):\n{\n  \"WaterPerLiquid\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Units of water required to produce one unit of liquid hand sanitizer\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 40\n  },\n  \"AlcoholPerLiquid\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Units of alcohol required to produce one unit of liquid hand sanitizer\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 50\n  },\n  \"WaterPerFoam\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Units of water required to produce one unit of foam hand sanitizer\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 60\n  },\n  \"AlcoholPerFoam\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Units of alcohol required to produce one unit of foam hand sanitizer\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 40\n  },\n  \"AvailableWater\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Total units of water available for production\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 2000\n  },\n  \"AvailableAlcohol\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Total units of alcohol available for production\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 2100\n  },\n  \"MaxLiquidProduction\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Maximum number of liquid hand sanitizers that can be produced\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 30\n  },\n  \"HandsCleanedPerLiquid\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Number of hands cleaned by one unit of liquid hand sanitizer\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 30\n  },\n  \"HandsCleanedPerFoam\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Number of hands cleaned by one unit of foam hand sanitizer\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": [],\n    \"value\": 20\n  }\n}\n\nKnown decision variables defined so far (JSON):\n{\n  \"numLiquid\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Number of liquid hand sanitizers produced\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": []\n  },\n  \"numFoam\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Number of foam hand sanitizers produced\",\n    \"type\": \"int\",\n    \"shape\": []\n  }\n}\n\nObjective (natural language):\n\"The goal is to maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned by producing liquid and foam hand sanitizers\"\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object:\n{\n  \"FORMULATION\": \"<LaTeX expression wrapped in $$ ... $$>\",\n  \"CODE\": null\n}\n\nGuidelines:\n- Use existing parameters/variables only.\n- Keep the LaTeX within $$ ... $$ and ensure it represents a maximize/minimize statement.\n- Do not include explanatory text outside the JSON object.\n",
